Mitosis Detection Model Overview

Objective:
To build and train a model for mitosis detection using TensorFlow and EfficientNetV2.

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load your training data from a DataFrame (assuming columns 'filename' and 'label').
Read and decode images using TensorFlow functions.
Resize and rescale images to the desired size.
Apply data augmentation operations for improved model generalization.

2. Model Architecture:

Build a model using EfficientNetV2 as the base model.
Freeze the base model's weights.
Add GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense, BatchNormalization, Dropout layers for feature extraction and classification.
Compile the model using Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

3. Model Training:

Set up callbacks, e.g., ModelCheckpoint, to save the best model.
Train the model using the preprocessed data.
Monitor training progress with metrics like accuracy.

4. Evaluation:

If you have a validation dataset, evaluate the model's performance on it.
Calculate and print validation accuracy.

5. Save Model (Optional):

Save the trained model for future use.
